Ex01 - Investigating Polynomials

This project is an assignment in Introduction to Computer Science in Arial university.
The goal is to implement various functions for analyzing and working with polynomials, using arrays and basic algorithmic techniques.

The project demonstrates my understanding of:

Arrays
Functions
Recursive methods
Polynomial operations
Implemented Functions

1. f()
   
Calculates the value of a polynomial for a given x.

3. root_rec
   
Finds a root of the polynomial using a recursive method.

5. polyFromPoints()
Constructs a polynomial from 2 or 3 distinct points.

6. equals()
Checks if two polynomials are identical.

7. poly
   
Converts an array representation of a polynomial into a readable string.


9. sameValue
   
Finds the points where two polynomials intersect.

8. length()
   
Calculates the length of the polynomial curve between two points.

9. area()
   
Calculates the area between two polynomials using a Riemann-like integration method.

10. getPolynomFromString
    
The opposite of poly():
Takes a polynomial string and converts it into an array
(works only with the exact string format returned by poly()).

12. add
    
Adds two polynomials.

14. mul
    
Multiplies two polynomials.

16. derivative
    
Computes the derivative of a polynomial.

18. mp
    
Multiplies the polynomial by a scalar.
